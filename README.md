# AoEIIDE-Monk

Really specific macro to manage monks in Age of Empires 2 Definitive. In-game setup: Hot-group a group of monks into group no. 2 or no. 3. Then, simply select group 2 or 3 to default to that group, then press left alt whenever you want to switch to the next monk. Only works in 1440p, it's only a simple matter of numbers to get 1080p or 4k.
